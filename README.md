Monitoring for a Solarsystem

The "DLN-komprimiert.pdf" is a research paper on a solar monitoring system designed and implemented by Harun Dastekin. The system utilizes a network of wireless sensors to collect data on various parameters such as solar radiation, temperature, and humidity, which are critical in monitoring the performance of solar panels. The collected data is then analyzed using a machine learning algorithm to identify patterns and anomalies that could indicate problems with the solar panel system.

The paper describes the hardware and software components of the solar monitoring system in detail, including the design of the wireless sensor nodes, the communication protocol used, and the machine learning algorithm employed for data analysis. The results of experiments conducted using the system are presented, demonstrating the system's effectiveness in identifying anomalies in the performance of solar panels.

Overall, the "DLN-komprimiert.pdf" presents a comprehensive overview of the design and implementation of a solar monitoring system and the benefits it can offer in terms of improving the efficiency and reliability of solar panel systems.
